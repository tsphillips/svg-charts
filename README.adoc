Very simple pie chart for SVG.

== About

This is a bare-bones pie chart function for SVG image elements in web pages.
I built something (more elaborate) for another project and wanted to release the essence of the pie chart into the world.
The core code here is simple, elegant, and provides a convenient way to render arcs in SVG.

I do not know if I will ever maintain this code beyond what is seen here.

_Caveat utilitor_.
